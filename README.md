# Transfer-Learning-on-a-ResNet50
Codes used for the transfer learning of a ResNet50 model. This model, pre-trained on VGGFace2, has its final layers replaced for learning to recognize identities from a smaller private dataset.
Some sections of code where taken from other GitHub repositories. In such cases, a link to the source repositories is provided within a comment.

TODO: Change file path references to local project paths.
TODO: Credit source repositories directly in README.
